Hole Description: 
This hole captures the energy and chaos of Times Square, one of New York Cityâ€™s most iconic spots. Bright lights, fast cars, billboard blockades, rolling down buildings, and nonstop movement make it a challenge to reach the end.

Play the role of a pedestrian navigating the city and carefully guide your marble through the course with flashing lights while avoiding rotating cars that can block or redirect your shot.

Once the marble is in the hole, you've made it across Times Square safely!
